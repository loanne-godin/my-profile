	  	     <h2>Travels ✈️</h2>
		       <p>
		         Ever since I moved to Singapore, my love for travel has grown immensely. Living in a city with such a diverse mix of cultures and people has inspired me to explore and learn more about the world we live in. I have been fortunate enough to visit several countries in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia (Bali and Bintan), Vietnam (Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh), the Philippines (El Nido, Coron, and Manila), and Thailand (Phuket). Each trip has been a unique and enriching experience, allowing me to immerse myself in new cultures, try different foods, and meet fascinating people. I feel grateful for these opportunities and can't wait to continue my travels and learn even more about the world around us.🌍</p>

 		      <h2>Community and student life 🤝</h2>
	        <p>
		        As an ESSEC Global BBA on the Singapore campus, I have the honour of being the President of my school's Volunteering Club. This role allows me to engage with other students and collaborate on meaningful volunteer projects that have a positive impact on the community and the environment (beach clean-ups, wheeling heart, gardening, fundraising, toy drives…).
            In addition to my work in the volunteer club, I am also responsible for communication in the student council. Through this role, I have had the opportunity to develop my skills in communication, use of social media, and promoting events and initiatives that benefit the student body. 
            My involvement in these leadership positions is an important part of my university experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to my school community.🫂</p>

	  	    <h2>Judo practice 🥋</h2>
		      <p>
            Before moving to Singapore, I was a dedicated judo athlete and competed at the national level for five years. During my time in France, I achieved numerous national rankings and honours, including finishing 3rd in the French Cadet Espoir Championships in 2020. Judo has been a huge part of my life, teaching me discipline, perseverance, and the importance of hard work. Although I am no longer competing at the national level due to my studies abroad, I still actively practice judo and continue to find joy in the sport. Judo has not only helped me to stay physically fit and healthy but has also taught me important life skills that I carry with me to this day.🧘‍♀️</p>
